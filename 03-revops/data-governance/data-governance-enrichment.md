# Data Governance — Enrichment Strategies

How to enrich CRM data: tools, waterfall approach, automation, and quality control.

---

## Why Enrichment Matters

**B2B data decays at 2.1% per month (22.5% annually).** Without enrichment:
- Job titles are 50-65% outdated within a year
- Email addresses decay 37% annually
- Phone numbers decay 43% annually

Enrichment keeps your CRM current and your outreach effective.

## Enrichment Hierarchy

Not all enrichment sources are equal. Prioritize by accuracy:

| Source | Accuracy | Coverage | Cost | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Manual research** | 95%+ | Low | High (time) | High-value accounts, executives |
| **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** | 90%+ | High | $$$ | Job titles, company info |
| **Clay** | 85-90% | High | $$ | Bulk enrichment, waterfall approach |
| **ZoomInfo** | 80-85% | Very High | $$$$ | Enterprise, comprehensive data |
| **Apollo** | 75-80% | High | $ | Cost-effective bulk enrichment |
| **Clearbit** | 80-85% | Medium | $$$ | Tech stack, firmographics |
| **Lusha** | 75-85% | Medium | $$ | Phone numbers, emails |
| **Hunter** | 70-75% | Medium | $ | Email finding only |

## Waterfall Enrichment Strategy

Don't rely on one source. Use a waterfall approach where each step fills gaps from the previous:

```
Step 1: Check existing CRM data (free)
  ↓ If missing fields
Step 2: Clay enrichment (uses multiple sources)
  ↓ If still missing
Step 3: ZoomInfo/Apollo lookup
  ↓ If still missing
Step 4: LinkedIn Sales Navigator
  ↓ If still missing
Step 5: Manual research
  ↓ If still missing
Step 6: Flag for human verification
```

### Clay Waterfall Example

```
Clay Column Configuration:

1. Find Email (Waterfall)
   → Apollo → ZoomInfo → Lusha → Hunter
   → Takes first valid result

2. Find Phone (Waterfall)
   → ZoomInfo → Apollo → Lusha
   → Takes first valid result

3. Enrich Company (Waterfall)
   → Clearbit → ZoomInfo → Apollo
   → Takes first valid result

4. Find LinkedIn URL
   → Apollo → ZoomInfo
   → Validate with LinkedIn profile lookup
```

## HubSpot Enrichment Configuration

### Workflow: Auto-Enrich New Leads

```
Trigger: Contact created with Email filled

Actions:
1. Delay 5 minutes (allow HubSpot native enrichment)

2. Branch: If Company Name blank
   → Use Clay webhook to find company from email domain
   → Update Company Name, Industry, Employee Count

3. Branch: If Phone blank
   → Use Clay webhook to find phone
   → Update Phone property

4. Branch: If Job Title blank
   → Use Clay webhook to find title
   → Update Job Title and Seniority Level

5. Set "Enrichment Status" = "Completed"
6. Set "Enrichment Date" = Today
```

### Workflow: Pre-Campaign Enrichment

```
Trigger: Added to list "Campaign - [Name] - Outreach"

Actions:
1. Branch: If "Email Verified" != "Valid"
   → Use NeverBounce webhook to verify
   → Update "Email Verified" status

2. Branch: If "Last Enriched" > 90 days ago
   → Trigger full enrichment workflow
   → Update all stale fields

3. Branch: If "Email Verified" = "Invalid"
   → Remove from list
   → Add to "Bad Emails" list

4. Set "Ready for Campaign" = Yes
```

### Workflow: Scheduled Refresh

```
Trigger: Scheduled daily at 2:00 AM

Enrollment: Contacts where:
- Last Enriched > 180 days ago
- Lifecycle Stage = [MQL, SQL, Opportunity]
- Limit: 500 contacts per day (cost management)

Actions:
1. Use Clay webhook for full enrichment
2. Update enriched fields
3. Set "Last Enriched" = Today
4. Log activity "Enrichment refresh completed"
```

## Enrichment Quality Control

### Validation After Enrichment

| Field | Validation Check | Action if Failed |
|---|---|---|
| **Email** | Valid format, verified deliverable | Flag, don't use in campaigns |
| **Phone** | Valid format, 7-15 digits | Flag for manual review |
| **Job Title** | In approved list OR reasonable | Flag if nonsensical |
| **Company Size** | Within expected range for industry | Flag if outlier |
| **Industry** | From standardized list | Map or flag |
| **Revenue** | Positive number, reasonable for size | Flag if outlier |

### Quality Metrics to Track

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|---|---|---|
| **Enrichment coverage** | Records enriched / Total records | >80% |
| **Field fill rate post-enrichment** | Filled fields / Target fields | >90% |
| **Email verification rate** | Valid emails / Total emails | >85% |
| **Enrichment accuracy** | Spot-check sample for correctness | >90% |
| **Cost per enriched record** | Total enrichment cost / Records enriched | Track trend |

## Cost Management

### Credit Allocation Strategy

| Priority | Segment | Enrichment Level | Budget % |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | MQLs and SQLs | Full enrichment | 40% |
| **2** | Target accounts (ABM) | Full enrichment | 30% |
| **3** | New leads | Essential fields only | 20% |
| **4** | Database refresh | Verification only | 10% |

### Credit Optimization Tips

```
1. Don't re-enrich unnecessarily
   - Check existing data first
   - Set minimum time between enrichments (90 days)

2. Prioritize high-value records
   - Enrich MQLs before raw leads
   - Enrich target accounts first

3. Use appropriate sources
   - Free sources first (LinkedIn public data)
   - Cheap sources for low-value records
   - Premium sources for high-value only

4. Batch for efficiency
   - Batch requests where possible
   - Off-peak pricing if available
```

### Cost Tracking Dashboard

| Metric | Calculation | Benchmark |
|---|---|---|
| **Cost per enriched contact** | Enrichment spend / Contacts enriched | $0.10-0.50 |
| **Cost per verified email** | Verification spend / Emails verified | $0.01-0.05 |
| **Enrichment ROI** | (Pipeline from enriched contacts - Cost) / Cost | >5x |
| **Budget pacing** | Month-to-date spend / Monthly budget | <100% |

## Multi-Source Integration

### API Integration Pattern

```
For each enrichment request:

1. Check cache (Clay, CRM)
   IF found AND fresh (< 90 days)
   → Return cached data

2. Waterfall through providers
   FOR each provider in priority order:
     → Make API request
     → IF valid data returned
        → Save to cache
        → Return data
        → Exit loop
     → ELSE continue to next provider

3. If no provider returns data
   → Flag for manual research
   → Return partial data with flag
```

### Provider Selection Matrix

| Use Case | Primary | Secondary | Tertiary |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Email discovery** | Apollo | ZoomInfo | Hunter |
| **Phone discovery** | ZoomInfo | Lusha | Apollo |
| **Job title verification** | LinkedIn | ZoomInfo | Apollo |
| **Company firmographics** | Clearbit | ZoomInfo | Apollo |
| **Tech stack** | BuiltWith | Clearbit | Wappalyzer |
| **Intent signals** | Bombora | G2 | ZoomInfo |

## Common Enrichment Mistakes

| Mistake | Impact | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Single source reliance | Low coverage, single point of failure | Waterfall approach |
| No validation | Bad data enters CRM | Validate after enrichment |
| Over-enriching | Wasted budget | Prioritize by value, set limits |
| Under-enriching | Stale data, missed opportunities | Regular refresh schedule |
| Ignoring cost | Budget overrun | Daily/weekly cost monitoring |
| No tracking | Can't measure ROI | Enrichment source tracking |
