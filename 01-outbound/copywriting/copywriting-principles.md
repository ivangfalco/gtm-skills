## The Core Philosophy

If you want your emails to draw attention, you need to make the reader think:

**"There's no way this email was for anyone else but me."**

Three things make a cold email NOT boring:
1. **Personal** — feels written for that one person
2. **Short** — gets the point across in as few lines as possible
3. **Valuable** — gives something worth their time

### What Makes Cold Emails Boring

- Impersonal or irrelevant (or both) — "industry leaders like yourself" sent to 10,000 people
- Unnecessarily long — nobody reads essays from strangers
- Generic value props — "optimize," "streamline," "save time"

---

## The Rules

**Bend these at your discretion — copywriting is more art than science. But these are the defaults:**

1. **Under 100 words** (ideally 50–75)
2. **More about them than you**
3. **Benefits over features**
4. **Solve a problem they actually have**
5. **Personalize or make it hyper-relevant**
6. **Pick your offer wisely**
7. **Provide value before asking for anything**

## Main Components of a Cold Email

Every email should have most of these:

### 1. Observation (Opener)

What you noticed about them. This is your hook — it must be relevant.

**Two types:**
- **Trigger-based** — a relevant event (hiring, funding, product launch, tech change)
- **Recency-based** — something recent (news, blog post, LinkedIn activity)

**Good observations tie to the problem you solve:**
- Change in their industry likely to impact their business
- Hiring trends / headcount growth or reduction
- Opening of new office locations
- Appointment of a new C-level
- Launch of a new product
- Increase in ad spend
- Merger / acquisition
- Recent fundraising
- Bad Glassdoor reviews (if selling HR/culture tools)
- Remote-first setup (if selling remote collaboration tools)
- Average employee tenure (if selling retention tools)

**The observation becomes your opener:**
- "Hey, I was looking at {{company}} on LinkedIn, and I noticed the average tenure is below 6 months"
- "Saw that Reach's latest blog post doesn't include a Meta tag which can affect its online visibility"
- "Noticed you have over 50 open positions on your job portal"

### 2. Value Proposition

What you actually do, stated in terms of outcomes:
- **Make money** — increase revenue, pipeline, conversions
- **Save money** — reduce costs, prevent waste
- **Save time** — automate, simplify, eliminate manual work

**Be specific, not generic:**
- Bad: "We help companies optimize their sales process"
- Good: "We help tech scale-ups reduce new employee churn from 30% to 10% or less"

### 3. Social Proof

Quantifiable results from real companies:
- "Companies like Uptech & Metadata increased average goal achievement by 40%"
- "LinkedIn, Netflix, and Indeed save 100s of hours weekly using our tool"
- "We recently helped {{client}} achieve {{result}} in {{timeframe}}"

**Rules for social proof:**
- Use numbers (%, $, time saved)
- Name real companies (if they're recognizable)
- Keep it to one sentence max

### 4. Call to Action (CTA)

**Soft CTA** (lower commitment — usually performs better):
- "Would this be something you're looking to solve?"
- "Worth exploring?"
- "Can I share how?"
- "Sound relevant?"
- "What do you think?"

**Hard CTA** (direct ask):
- "Worth a chat?"
- "Open for a quick call this week?"

**Avoid:** "Let me know" and "Let's get a call" (too vague or too pushy).

**Always end with a question** — it invites a reply.

### 5. P.S. Line (Bonus)

A great spot for:
- A personalized joke or observation
- A second social proof point
- A cheeky line that shows personality
- "P.S: Let me know if someone else would be the right person to talk to about this"

## Research & Segmentation

Before writing the email, ask: **Who should I go after? Who is struggling the most with the problem I solve?**

### Finding Buying Signals

If you have existing clients, ask:
- What made them want to reach out?
- What made them buy?
- What patterns do they share?

### Examples of Buying Signals

| Signal | What It Means | Example Use |
|---|---|---|
| Bad Glassdoor reviews | High churn, unhappy employees | Selling HR/culture/retention tools |
| Remote-first company | Harder to monitor wellbeing | Selling remote collaboration/engagement |
| Short average tenure (<6mo) | Active retention problem | Selling employee engagement platforms |
| Hiring for specific roles | Budget allocated, active need | Selling tools that serve those roles |
| Recent funding | Fresh capital to spend | Any B2B solution |
| Increasing ad spend | Growing acquisition efforts | Selling marketing/creative services |
| Tech stack changes | Open to new vendors | Selling competing/complementary tools |

**The signal becomes the opener. The opener draws attention because you're highlighting an issue they know they have.**

## Tips from the Best

### Ask Yourself Before Sending (Eric Nowoslawski)
1. How can I make this email worth this person's time?
2. How can I say it like a human would say it?
3. What can you say in a cold email that your competitors can't say?

### Be Cheeky (Josh Braun)
People don't lose their sense of humor when they go to work. When you make a prospect smile, their brain says "Hey, that made me feel good; I'm going to respond."

**Funny sign-off examples:**
- "Awaiting your fair but stern reply."
- "Awaiting your profanity-filled response."

### Be Specific / Crispy (Josh Braun)
The more specific you are, the more credible you are.

**Don't say this → Say this instead:**

| Don't | Do |
|---|---|
| "Lose 50 pounds in 2 weeks" | "Are you open to a different perspective for losing weight without dieting?" |
| "Build a $1M portfolio in 60 days" | "How are you protecting your portfolio against market downturns?" |
| "Increase sign-ups by 10X" | "Have you considered using finfluencers on TikTok to reach young customers?" |
| "We reduce shipping costs" | "We're seeing e-com companies in the pet space overpaying for shipping by 10-15%. One reason is the weight and dimensions of boxes for pet products. Worth exploring for Animal Pharm?" |

### Write with an Eraser (Josh Braun)
Cut ruthlessly. Every word must earn its place.

### Use Loss Aversion
Frame what they're losing by NOT acting, not just what they'd gain.

### Offer Rules
Don't make the offer too good to be true (even if it is). Plausible > grandiose.

### Subject Lines
- 1–3 words on the subject matter
- Add a space or two before the subject to create a pattern interrupt
- Keep it casual and curiosity-driven

---

## Personalization: Dos and Don'ts

### Don't
- Generic AI compliments ("Loved your post about leadership!")
- Sound the same as what the prospect already gets
- One bit of irrelevant info about their school or hobby

### Do
- Custom prompts that reference real, relevant data
- Interests/facts that prospects consistently care about
- Observations tied to the problem you solve

**Example:** Personalizing based on when the business was founded — founders are immensely proud of their longevity.

## Spam Word Avoidance

### Why It Matters

Email providers scan content for spam patterns. Too many trigger words = higher spam score = junk folder.

### Common Spam Word Categories

| Category | Examples to Avoid |
|---|---|
| Urgency & Pressure | "Act now," "Limited time," "Urgent," "Don't miss out," "Expires soon" |
| Money & Offers | "Free," "Discount," "Cash," "Save big," "Double your," "Earn $," "100% free" |
| Too Good to Be True | "Guarantee," "No obligation," "Risk-free," "Winner," "Congratulations" |
| Salesy Language | "Buy now," "Order today," "Click here," "Call now," "Subscribe" |
| Suspicious | "This isn't spam," "You've been selected," "Dear friend," "As seen on" |

### Generic Words to Avoid in B2B Copy

"Optimize," "streamline," "save time," "save money," "leverage," "synergy," "cutting-edge," "best-in-class" — everyone uses them, so they don't stand out.

### Spam Checker Tools

- **ColdIQ Email Spam Checker** — https://coldiq.com/free-tools/email-spam-checker
- **Salesforge Spam Checker** — https://www.salesforge.ai/tools/email-spam-checker
- **Mailmeteor Spam Checker** — https://mailmeteor.com/spam-checker
- **Instantly built-in checker** — available in the sequence editor

**Best practice:** Run every campaign through a spam checker before sending. If it flags issues, rewrite with more natural, conversational language.
