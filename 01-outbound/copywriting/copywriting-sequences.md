# Cold Email Copywriting — Sequences

How to structure a full email sequence: Email 1 variations, follow-ups, timing, and structure.

---

## Sequence Structure Overview

| Email | Timing | Goal | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Email 1** | Day 0 | Get the reply | 80% of positive replies come here. Test 3–4 variations. |
| **Email 2** | Day 3 (same thread) | Add value / follow up | Lead magnet, social proof, different angle |
| **Email 3** | Day 17 (new subject line) | Final attempt | New angle, very soft CTA, break-up |

If no reply after Email 3 → wait 3 months, then re-engage with a fresh sequence.

## Email 1 — Variations

80% of positive replies come from Email 1. Test 3–4 different variations of your value proposition and CTA.

### v1: Observation + Solution + Social Proof + CTA

**Template:**
> Hey {{first_name}},
>
> {{observation — poke the bear question}}
>
> Solution
>
> Social Proof
>
> CTA

**Example:**
> Hey John,
>
> Saw you are the head of people and culture of a 50+ people company — I was wondering how you ensure every employee is engaged & productive?
>
> We developed an AI copilot that gives you a data-backed understanding of each employee, generates OKRs, summarizes performance reviews, and monitors engagement & burnout.
>
> Companies like Uptech & Metadata increased their average goal achievement by 40% and identified 3 at-risk employees.
>
> Would you like to try it?

---

### v2: Observation + Problem + Solution & Social Proof + CTA + P.S.

**Template:**
> Hey {{first_name}},
>
> {{observation — poke the bear question}}
>
> {{problem}}
>
> Solution & social proof
>
> CTA
>
> PS: Social proof

**Example:**
> Hey G,
>
> Saw that there are more than 80 people at Lemlist — do you have any software upgrades or rollouts coming up?
>
> As tech-stacks get more complex, documenting SOPs takes hours and employees ignore training videos & documentation.
>
> Tango captures processes as you do them, and once your process is captured, our AI screen overlay guides viewers through step-by-step.
>
> Could I send over our demo?
>
> PS: LinkedIn, Netflix, and Indeed are also big fans of Tango and save 100s of hours weekly using our tool :)

### v3: First Line + Poke the Bear + Similar Companies + CTA

**Template:**
> Hey {{first_name}} — {{relevant first line}}
>
> {{poke the bear question}}
>
> We're helping companies like {{company_name}} achieve {{outcome}} in {{timeframe}} without {{no good rotten thing}}.
>
> Would this be something you're looking to solve as well?

**Example:**
> Hey Fivos,
>
> Are you manually creating proposals for every new deal?
>
> We're helping agencies like ColdIQ to replace PowerPoint & PandaDoc and impress with visuals, without needing a designer.
>
> Would this be something you're looking to solve as well?

---

### v4: Trigger + Problem + Solution + Calculation + CTA

**Template:**
> {{first_name}}, {{personalized trigger}}
>
> {{problem}}
>
> {{solution}}
>
> {{calculation}}
>
> CTA

**Example:**
> Mary, noticed you have over 50 open positions on your job portal.
>
> We help tech scale-ups reduce their new employee churn from 30% to 10% or less.
>
> With a typical cost of mis-hire around $30,000 per employee, this would mean going from 15 mis-hires to 5, resulting in $300,000 saved.
>
> Worth a chat?

---

### v5: Recency + Stat + Question + Problem Link + Value CTA

**Template:**
> Hi {{first_name}} — recency waterfall
>
> Stat
>
> Question
>
> Link to the problem you solve
>
> Value CTA

**Example:**
> Hi {{first_name}},
>
> 53% of founders say their emails don't get enough replies.
>
> How many meetings does {{company_name}} need each week to hit revenue targets?
>
> Whether it's 4 or 40, it's frustrating when your emails stop working.
>
> Could I share a cold email template that brings us 50+ meetings per week?

---

### v6: Trigger + Social Proof Achievement + CTA

**Template:**
> {{first_name}} — relevant trigger
>
> Social proof — achievement
>
> CTA

**Example:**
> Fivos, saw that Reach's latest blog post doesn't include a Meta tag which can affect its online visibility.
>
> {{client}} improved theirs by creating meta tags using ChatGPT.
>
> Can I share how?

---

### v7: Poke the Bear (Job Frustration) + Steps + Solution + CTA

**Template:**
> Hey {{first_name}},
>
> What {{title}} hate about their job is {{main problem with how they currently do their job}}.
>
> Stuff like [step 1], [step 2], [step 3], etc.
>
> Our tech enables you to {{solution}}
>
> [Answer to the most likely follow-up question]
>
> Soft CTA

**Example:**
> Hey {{first_name}},
>
> What IT Managers in healthcare hate about their job is maintaining data security and system efficiency.
>
> Issues like system downtimes, patient data protection, and regulatory compliance can be overwhelming.
>
> Our tech enables robust IT security solutions tailored for healthcare, ensuring data protection and compliance.
>
> Totally compatible with your existing system.
>
> Sound relevant?

## Email 2 — Follow-Up (Day 3, Same Thread)

**Template:**
> {{first_name}}, here's the {{lead magnet}}
>
> Social proof
>
> Value proposition
>
> CTA

**Key rules:**
- Same thread as Email 1 (reply to your own email)
- Lead with value (lead magnet, resource, case study)
- Keep it even shorter than Email 1
- Don't repeat the same pitch — add a new angle

---

## Email 3 — New Subject Line (Day 17)

**Key rules:**
- **New subject line** (fresh thread)
- Choose a different Email 1 variation than you used originally
- Very soft CTA
- We're aiming for ANY kind of answer
- If no reply → wait 3 months before re-engaging

**Template:**
> Hook
>
> Statement
>
> Consequence
>
> Consequence
>
> Consequence
>
> CTA

**Example:**
> {{first_name}},
>
> Most sales leaders I speak to are a *little* embarrassed by the presentation of the proposals going out to prospects.
>
> Qwilr helps you stand out from the crowd when going head-to-head with other agencies.
>
> Web-based personalized proposals without needing a designer.
>
> With analytics on how much time your prospect spent reviewing each page.
>
> Curious to see how it works?
>
> PS: Let me know if someone else would be the right person to talk to about this :)

## Sequence Design Rules

1. **Email 1 gets 80% of replies** — invest most effort here
2. **Test 3–4 variations** of Email 1 simultaneously (A/B/C/D test)
3. **Same thread for Email 2** — reply to yourself
4. **New subject line for Email 3** — fresh start
5. **Include soft CTA like "Would {{other_colleague}} be a better person to chat about this?"** in Email 3
6. **If no reply after 3 emails** — wait 3 months, then re-engage
7. **Never more than 3 emails in a sequence** without a significant pause
8. **Every email should provide standalone value** — don't write "just following up"
