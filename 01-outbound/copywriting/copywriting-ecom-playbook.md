# Outbound to E-Commerce Brands — The Playbook

Specific playbook for selling services to e-commerce brands via cold email.

---

## The E-Com Reality Check

E-commerce founders and marketing heads are flooded:
- 100+ cold emails per day hitting their inbox
- Ignoring most messages by default
- Extremely jaded by overhyped case studies
- Trust at rock-bottom
- They've heard every "Klaviyo audit," "2x ROAS," and "$50k/mo email marketing" pitch ten thousand times

**The question:** If the entire market is saturated and skeptical, how do you break through?

**The answer:** You have to OFFER MORE and DO MORE than every other agency. Your offer is the only thing that will break the pattern.

## Why Most Agency Offers Fail

These offers are dead:
- "Free Klaviyo audit"
- "2x ROAS in 90 days"
- "Add $50k/mo with email marketing"

E-com brands have seen them for a decade. Nothing feels new, safe, or worth replying to.

## What Actually Works: Low-Risk, High-Value, Easy-Yes Offers

Offers that convert because they do the work upfront:

### Free Work Offers

- Free welcome flow for their newsletter
- Free cart-abandonment flow
- Free product page rewrite
- Free ad creative example
- Free TikTok concept storyboard
- Free UGC script
- Free CRO audit (with screenshots)
- Free checkout page mock-up

**Why these work:**
- Give value before money is discussed
- Require zero commitment
- Prove your skills without bragging
- Feel specific, not generic

### Lead Magnet Ideas

- "How we grew Brand X's AOV by 27% with simple checkout tweaks"
- "5 TikTok Shop optimizations that boosted 14% conversion overnight"
- "Why 92% of Shopify brands waste money on Meta ads"
- "3 hooks dominating TikTok ads this quarter"

### Trends to Watch (Offer Angles)

- TikTok Shop setup/optimization
- Influencer-driven creative
- Micro-UGC bundles
- Onsite CRO quick wins
- Top-of-funnel TikTok ad concepts
- Checkout optimization

## E-Com List Building (Keep It Simple)

### Step 1: Broad List in Apollo

- Industry Keywords: Apparel, Beauty, Health & Wellness, Jewelry, Outdoor, Supplements
- Technology filters: Shopify, WooCommerce, Klaviyo
- 10K–50K rows at a time is normal

### Step 2: Qualification in Clay

- Confirm it's actually an e-com brand
- Optional: check if they run Meta/TikTok ads
- Add revenue or traffic estimates if helpful

### Step 3: Waterfall Enrichment

- Apollo → LeadMagic → Prospeo → Findymail (or your preferred stack)

**Why this works:** You don't need fancy data tools. You need reach, relevance, and speed. Apollo + Clay covers that.

## E-Com Messaging Rules

E-com founders don't want to read essays.

1. **15–30 words max**
2. Emphasize the offer, not the agency
3. Only include case studies if the brand is well-known
4. Always offer a lead magnet
5. Keep the tone casual and value-first
6. No paragraphs longer than one line

---

## Proven E-Com Frameworks

### Email A: Free Work Offer

> {{FIRST_NAME}}, interested in {{FREE WORK}} for {{COMPANY}}?
>
> We recently helped {{CLIENT}} with {{RELEVANT PROJECT}} achieve {{RESULT}}, figured this might help. Thoughts?

### Email B: Lead Magnet Offer

> {{FIRST_NAME}}, created {{LEAD MAGNET}} showing how we generated {{RESULT}} for {{CLIENT}} using {{UNIQUE STRATEGY}}. Want me to send it?

## Key Takeaways

Winning in e-com outbound is NOT about:
- Being louder
- Sending more emails
- Having a bigger case study deck

It IS about:
- Being more relevant
- Delivering more value upfront
- Crafting an offer that feels new and safe
- Respecting the founder's time

When everyone else sends the same tired "audit" email, you send something that actually helps. That's how you break through.
