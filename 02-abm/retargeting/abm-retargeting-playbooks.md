# ABM Retargeting — Playbooks

Specific playbooks for common ABM retargeting scenarios: engaged-no-demo, demo-no-show, lost deal win-back, and churned customer re-acquisition.

---

## Playbook 1: Engaged But No Demo

**Scenario:** Account has engaged heavily with content, ads, and website but hasn't booked a demo or meeting.

### Trigger Criteria

```
Account qualifies when:
- 5+ ad engagements OR 3+ website visits
- Visited high-intent page (pricing, product, case studies)
- No demo/meeting in CRM
- Active in last 30 days
- Matches ICP criteria
```

### Why They're Stuck

| Possible Reason | Signals | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| **Not ready yet** | Browsing content, not pricing | Continue nurturing with education |
| **Need more proof** | Viewing case studies repeatedly | Heavy social proof campaign |
| **Unclear value prop** | Bouncing from pricing page | Simplify messaging, address objections |
| **Wrong persona engaged** | IC engaging, not decision maker | Expand to buying committee |
| **Friction in booking** | Visited demo page, didn't book | Simplify booking process |

### Campaign Sequence (21 Days)

```
Day 0:  Trigger — Account hits engagement threshold

Day 1:  LinkedIn Ad: Case study from similar company
        Email: "Companies like [similar company] saw X results"

Day 3:  Meta Ad: Customer testimonial video
        BDR: LinkedIn connection request to champion

Day 5:  LinkedIn Ad: ROI calculator or value tool
        Email: Invite to upcoming webinar/event

Day 7:  BDR: First outreach email (personalized to engagement)
        LinkedIn Ad: Comparison content (vs. status quo)

Day 10: Meta Ad: Product demo teaser (90-second video)
        BDR: LinkedIn message follow-up

Day 14: LinkedIn Ad: Direct offer — "Free strategy session"
        Email: Case study + soft CTA
        BDR: Phone attempt (if number available)

Day 17: Direct Mail: Personalized package (if Tier 1 account)
        LinkedIn Ad: Urgency messaging

Day 21: Decision point:
        → If engaged: Move to active sales sequence
        → If no engagement: Move to "Warm" segment, reduce frequency
```

### Content Strategy

| Day Range | Content Type | Message Theme |
|---|---|---|
| 1-7 | Social proof, case studies | "Others like you succeeded" |
| 8-14 | Value tools, ROI content | "Here's what you're missing" |
| 15-21 | Direct offers, urgency | "Let's talk — no commitment" |

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|---|---|---|
| Demo booking rate | 15-25% of segment | CRM demo tracking |
| Time to demo | < 21 days from trigger | Days from trigger to meeting |
| BDR reply rate | 20-30% | Outreach tool data |
| Ad CTR (this segment) | 0.6-0.9% | LinkedIn/Meta dashboards |

---

## Playbook 2: Demo No-Show

**Scenario:** Account booked a demo but didn't attend.

### Trigger Criteria

```
Account qualifies when:
- Demo scheduled in CRM
- Marked as "No Show" or "Cancelled"
- No reschedule within 48 hours
- Not disqualified
```

### Why They No-Showed

| Reason | Frequency | Recovery Approach |
|---|---|---|
| **Calendar conflict** | 40% | Easy reschedule, no hard sell |
| **Lost urgency** | 25% | Reactivate pain point |
| **Cold feet** | 20% | Reduce commitment, offer smaller next step |
| **Wrong time/priority** | 10% | Nurture, try again in 30-60 days |
| **Went with competitor** | 5% | Win-back sequence later |

### Campaign Sequence (14 Days)

```
Day 0:  Trigger — Demo marked as no-show

Day 1:  BDR Email: "No worries — here's a 1-click reschedule link"
        (Friendly, zero pressure, easy action)

Day 2:  LinkedIn Ad: Quick value reminder (stat or benefit)
        BDR: LinkedIn message — "Saw you couldn't make it"

Day 4:  Email: Share 2-minute video overview (async alternative)
        "In case you're short on time, here's what we would have covered"

Day 6:  LinkedIn Ad: Customer testimonial (similar company)
        Meta Ad: Same testimonial (cross-channel)

Day 8:  BDR: Phone call attempt
        Email: Offer reduced-commitment next step
        "Want to start with just a 15-min chat instead?"

Day 11: LinkedIn Ad: Comparison or pain point content
        BDR: Final email — "Should I close this out?"

Day 14: Decision point:
        → If rescheduled: Back to active sales
        → If engaged but not rescheduled: Move to "Warm" segment
        → If no engagement: Move to "Nurture" segment, check back in 60 days
```

### Messaging Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **No guilt** | Never make them feel bad for no-showing |
| **Reduce friction** | One-click reschedule, shorter meeting options |
| **Provide value anyway** | Send async content they would have seen |
| **Multiple channels** | Email + LinkedIn + ads simultaneously |
| **Know when to pause** | After 14 days of silence, give space |

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Reschedule rate | 30-40% within 14 days |
| Async engagement rate | 50%+ view the video/content |
| Time to reschedule | < 7 days average |
| Ultimate conversion (to demo) | 45-55% of no-shows |

## Playbook 3: Lost Deal Win-Back

**Scenario:** Deal was in pipeline but marked as closed-lost.

### Trigger Criteria

```
Account qualifies when:
- Deal stage = Closed-Lost
- Lost date: 30-180 days ago (not too fresh, not too stale)
- Loss reason NOT: "No budget ever" or "Disqualified"
- Not marked as "Do not contact"
```

### Win-Back Timing Windows

| Time Since Loss | Win-Back Probability | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| **0-30 days** | Low (15%) | Too soon — they just decided. Light touch only. |
| **30-90 days** | Medium (25%) | Ideal window — circumstances may have changed |
| **90-180 days** | Medium-High (30%) | New quarter, new budget, new priorities |
| **180-365 days** | Medium (20%) | Annual planning cycle, worth a shot |
| **365+ days** | Low (10%) | Treat as new account, fresh start |

### Segmentation by Loss Reason

| Loss Reason | Win-Back Strategy | Content Focus |
|---|---|---|
| **Chose competitor** | Wait 90+ days, highlight differentiators | Comparison content, competitive displacement |
| **Timing/not ready** | Nurture 60-90 days, re-engage gently | New content, updated features |
| **Budget constraints** | Wait for new quarter/fiscal year | ROI content, cost-saving angles |
| **No decision** | Re-activate the pain point | Industry trends, peer pressure |
| **Internal politics** | Target different stakeholders | Champion change, buying committee expansion |

### Campaign Sequence (30 Days)

```
Day 0:  Trigger — Account enters win-back segment

Day 1:  LinkedIn Ad: Industry trend or thought leadership
        (Don't mention the old deal — fresh start)

Day 5:  Email: Share new content/case study/feature
        "Thought you'd find this interesting"

Day 8:  LinkedIn Ad: New customer success story (similar company)
        Meta Ad: Same story (cross-channel reach)

Day 12: BDR: LinkedIn message — soft check-in
        "We've shipped some updates since we last spoke"

Day 15: LinkedIn Ad: New feature or product update
        Email: Specific update relevant to their use case

Day 20: BDR: Outreach email — offer new demo/catch-up
        LinkedIn Ad: Direct offer with clear CTA

Day 25: Meta Ad: Retargeting for those who engaged
        Direct Mail: If Tier 1 account and engaged

Day 30: Decision point:
        → If meeting booked: Active sales
        → If engaged: Continue nurture sequence
        → If no engagement: Park for 90 days, try again
```

### Win-Back Messaging Framework

| Phase | Message Theme | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Re-introduction** (Days 1-10) | "Things have changed" | New features, new customers, new results |
| **Value reinforcement** (Days 11-20) | "Here's what you're missing" | ROI proof, competitive insights |
| **Direct ask** (Days 21-30) | "Let's reconnect" | Clear meeting ask, easy scheduling |

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Win-back meeting rate | 10-15% of lost deals |
| Win-back close rate | 20-30% of those who take meeting |
| Time to reactivation | 60-90 days average |
| Pipeline influenced | Track separately from new business |

## Playbook 4: Churned Customer Re-Acquisition

**Scenario:** Customer cancelled or didn't renew.

### Trigger Criteria

```
Account qualifies when:
- Customer status = Churned/Cancelled
- Churn date: 30-365 days ago
- Not churned due to company closure
- No active legal/collections issues
- Was in good standing before churn
```

### Churn Reason Segmentation

| Churn Reason | Recovery Difficulty | Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| **Budget cuts** | Medium | Wait for new budget cycle, emphasize ROI |
| **Switched to competitor** | Hard | Long game — 6-12 months, highlight weaknesses |
| **Poor experience/support** | Medium | Acknowledge, show improvements made |
| **Didn't see value** | Medium-Hard | Education + new use cases + success stories |
| **Champion left** | Medium | Find new champion, fresh pitch |
| **Merged/acquired** | Medium | New decision makers, treat as new account |

### Campaign Sequence (45 Days)

```
Day 0:  Trigger — Account enters churned segment (30+ days post-churn)

Day 3:  LinkedIn Ad: Success story from current customer
        (Subtle reminder of value without hard sell)

Day 7:  Email: "We've made improvements"
        Share specific updates since they left

Day 12: LinkedIn Ad: New feature announcement
        Meta Ad: Same content

Day 17: BDR: Soft outreach — "Would love your feedback"
        (Not selling — asking for input shows respect)

Day 22: LinkedIn Ad: Industry content (thought leadership)
        Email: Relevant content piece

Day 28: BDR: LinkedIn message — mention specific improvement
        that addresses their churn reason

Day 33: LinkedIn Ad: Direct offer — "Come back and see what's new"
        Email: Special win-back offer if applicable

Day 38: Meta Ad: Testimonial from won-back customer
        BDR: Final outreach — clear ask

Day 45: Decision point:
        → If meeting booked: Re-acquisition sales process
        → If engaged: Continue nurture at lower frequency
        → If no engagement: Park for 6 months minimum
```

### Win-Back Offers (Use Sparingly)

| Offer Type | When to Use | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| **Extended trial** | Budget concerns, need to prove value | Low — they get to re-evaluate |
| **Discounted rate** | Price was issue, still good fit | Medium — sets precedent |
| **Free onboarding** | Poor adoption was issue | Low — addresses root cause |
| **Pilot program** | Risk averse, need proof | Low — reduced commitment |
| **None (value only)** | Competitor regret, feature gaps filled | Best — no margin erosion |

**Rule:** Lead with value, not discounts. Discounts should be last resort.

### Addressing Churn Reasons in Messaging

| Churn Reason | Don't Say | Do Say |
|---|---|---|
| **Budget** | "We can give you a discount" | "Here's how customers get 3x ROI" |
| **Competitor** | "They're worse than us" | "We've shipped X features since" |
| **Bad experience** | "We're better now" | "Here's specifically what we fixed" |
| **No value** | "You didn't use it right" | "Customers like X are seeing Y results by doing Z" |

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Re-acquisition rate | 5-10% of churned customers |
| Time to re-acquisition | 6-12 months average |
| Re-acquired customer retention | 80%+ (higher than first time) |
| Re-acquired LTV | Track separately from new customers |
