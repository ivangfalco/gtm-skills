## When to Use LinkedIn vs Google vs Meta

There is no single best channel. Each platform captures buyers at different awareness stages. The right mix depends on your ICP, budget, and product complexity.

### Platform Strengths for B2B

| Platform | Primary Strength | Best For | Weakest At |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LinkedIn** | Professional targeting (title, seniority, company, industry) | ABM, reaching specific personas, B2B awareness, thought leadership | Bottom-funnel direct response at scale |
| **Google Ads (Search)** | Capturing active buying intent | In-market buyers searching for solutions, competitor conquest | Building awareness with people who don't know they have a problem |
| **Google Ads (Display/YouTube)** | Broad reach and retargeting | Video awareness, retargeting website visitors | Precise B2B targeting (low match rates on work emails) |
| **Meta (Facebook/Instagram)** | Algorithm-driven audience finding, creative testing | Retargeting, lookalike expansion, high-volume lead gen | Precise B2B targeting (no job title/seniority data) |

### When to Choose Each

**Choose LinkedIn when:**
- Your ICP is defined by job title, seniority, company size, or industry
- You are running ABM and need to target specific company lists
- You need thought leadership distribution (TLAs)
- Your ACV is high enough ($15K+) to justify $8-22 CPCs
- You need to reach decision-makers who are not actively searching

**Choose Google Search when:**
- Buyers are actively searching for your solution category
- You have clear non-brand keywords with purchase intent
- Competitors are well-known and you want to capture comparison traffic
- You need fast pipeline from in-market buyers
- Product category is established (people know what to search for)

**Choose Google Display/YouTube when:**
- You need broad awareness at lower CPMs than LinkedIn
- You have strong video content (product demos, testimonials)
- You want to retarget website visitors across the web
- You are supplementing LinkedIn with additional touchpoints

**Choose Meta when:**
- You need high-volume lead generation at lower CPL than LinkedIn
- You have strong creative (Meta rewards creative quality heavily)
- You want to build lookalike audiences from customer data
- You are retargeting website visitors with conversion-focused ads
- Your ICP can be approximated by interests, behaviors, and lookalikes

### Platform Comparison: Key Metrics

| Metric | LinkedIn | Google Search | Google Display | Meta |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Avg CPC (B2B)** | $8-22 | $3-15 | $1-5 | $2-8 |
| **Avg CPM** | $33-65 | N/A (CPC model) | $5-15 | $8-25 |
| **Avg CPL (B2B SaaS)** | $50-200 | $30-150 | $20-80 | $25-100 |
| **B2B Targeting Precision** | Highest | Intent-based (keyword) | Low | Low-Medium |
| **Minimum Viable Budget** | $3K/month | $2K/month | $1K/month | $2K/month |
| **Time to First Results** | 2-4 weeks | 1-2 weeks | 1-2 weeks | 1-2 weeks |

## Channel Selection Framework Based on Buyer Awareness

Not all buyers are at the same stage. Match the channel to where the buyer is in their journey.

### The Five Awareness Stages

| Stage | Buyer State | What They Need | Best Channels |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Unaware** | Don't know they have a problem | Education, pattern interruption | LinkedIn (TLAs, thought leadership), YouTube |
| **Problem Aware** | Know the problem, don't know solutions exist | Content that validates their pain | LinkedIn, YouTube, Meta (content distribution) |
| **Solution Aware** | Know solutions exist, evaluating categories | Category education, comparison content | Google Search (non-brand keywords), LinkedIn, Meta |
| **Product Aware** | Know your product, evaluating fit | Social proof, demos, case studies | Google Search (brand + competitor), LinkedIn retargeting, Meta retargeting |
| **Offer Aware** | Ready to buy, comparing offers | Risk reversal, trials, pricing | Google Search (brand), LinkedIn BOF, Meta conversion campaigns |

### Channel-to-Stage Mapping

```
UNAWARE ──────────────── LinkedIn (TLAs, awareness), YouTube
                          |
PROBLEM AWARE ──────────── LinkedIn, YouTube, Meta (content)
                          |
SOLUTION AWARE ─────────── Google Search (non-brand), LinkedIn, Meta
                          |
PRODUCT AWARE ──────────── Google Search (brand + competitor), Retargeting (all platforms)
                          |
OFFER AWARE ────────────── Google Search (brand), LinkedIn BOF, Meta conversions
```

### The 95/5 Rule

Only ~5% of your B2B market is "in-market" at any given time. 90% of those buyers prefer vendors they already know.

**What this means for channel selection:**
- Google Search captures the 5% who are actively looking right now
- LinkedIn and Meta build awareness with the 95% so when they are ready, you are the obvious choice
- If you only run Google Search, you are competing for 5% of the market with every other vendor
- If you only run LinkedIn/Meta, you are building awareness but not capturing demand when it peaks

**The best B2B programs run both demand creation (LinkedIn/Meta) and demand capture (Google Search) simultaneously.**

## Budget Allocation Principles

### Starting Point: Work Bottom-Up

For fastest ROI, allocate budget starting from the bottom of the funnel and work up:

| Priority | Stage | Budget Range | ROI Timeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1st | **Capture** (Solution + Product Aware) | 30-50% | Fastest - <45 days |
| 2nd | **Accelerate** (Offer Aware, retargeting) | 10-20% | Fast - depends on sales cycle |
| 3rd | **Create** (Unaware + Problem Aware) | 30-50% | Slowest - >90 days |
| 4th | **Revive** (Closed-lost, churned) | 2-5% | Fast - <45 days |
| 5th | **Expand** (Existing customers) | 2-5% | Medium - <60 days |

### Budget Allocation by Company Stage

| Company Stage | Recommended Allocation | Logic |
|---|---|---|
| **Early stage, large TAM** (Series A, $30K/month) | 50% Create + 35% Capture + 15% Retargeting | Need brand awareness, large addressable market |
| **Growth stage, small TAM** (Series C, $30K/month) | 65% Create + 15% Capture + 15% Accelerate + 5% Revive | Small TAM = need ABM, help sales close deals |
| **Established, scaling** ($100K+/month) | 30% Create + 30% Capture + 20% Accelerate + 10% Expand + 10% Revive | Full-funnel coverage at scale |

### Cross-Channel Budget Split

| Budget | Recommended Channel Mix | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **$5K-10K/month** | 100% one channel | Pick the highest-impact channel for your situation. Don't spread thin. |
| **$10K-25K/month** | 60-70% primary + 30-40% secondary | Example: 70% LinkedIn + 30% Google Search |
| **$25K-50K/month** | 3 channels | Example: 40% LinkedIn + 35% Google + 25% Meta |
| **$50K+/month** | Full mix + testing | All channels active + budget for experimentation |

**Key rule:** Never run more channels than you can properly manage and optimize. One well-optimized channel beats three neglected channels.

### Budget Reallocation Triggers

| Signal | Action |
|---|---|
| One channel hitting CPL targets, another 3x above | Shift 20-30% from expensive to efficient |
| Google Search impressions capped (all demand captured) | Shift surplus to LinkedIn/Meta for demand creation |
| LinkedIn retargeting pool growing fast | Increase MOF/BOF budget to capitalize |
| Pipeline data shows one channel driving better quality | Increase investment in that channel |
| Seasonal demand spike (Q1 budget season, Q4 year-end) | Increase Capture budget temporarily |

## Cross-Channel Measurement

### The Measurement Problem in B2B

B2B buyers do not convert in a single session from a single channel. A typical B2B purchase journey:

1. Sees LinkedIn TLA - does not click
2. Searches on Google a week later - clicks a competitor's ad
3. Sees Meta retargeting ad - clicks and reads a case study
4. Goes directly to your site a month later - books a demo

**If you only measure last-click attribution, Google or direct traffic gets all the credit. LinkedIn gets none - even though it started the journey.**

### Measurement Framework

| Layer | What It Measures | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| **Platform metrics** | Clicks, CTR, CPC, impressions per channel | LinkedIn/Google/Meta native dashboards |
| **Website analytics** | Traffic sources, page views, conversions | Google Analytics, Segment |
| **CRM pipeline** | Which leads become opportunities and revenue | HubSpot, Salesforce |
| **Self-reported attribution** | "How did you hear about us?" on demo forms | Form field on website |
| **Impression-to-pipeline** | Which ad impressions correlated with pipeline | ZenABM, Fibbler, HockeyStack |

### Self-Reported Attribution (Non-Negotiable)

Add "How did you hear about us?" as a required free-text field on every demo/contact form.

**Why free-text, not dropdown:** Dropdowns bias responses to the options you provide. Free-text reveals channels you did not expect. Common responses: "LinkedIn ad", "saw a post from your CEO", "a colleague sent me a link", "podcast mention."

**This single field provides more accurate attribution insight than any multi-touch attribution software.**

### What to Measure by Channel

| Channel | Leading Indicators | Lagging Indicators |
|---|---|---|
| **LinkedIn** | Impressions, engagement rate, retargeting pool growth, CTR | Pipeline attributed, accounts progressing stages, pipeline per $ spent |
| **Google Search** | Impressions, click share, CPC, conversion rate | Cost per SQL, revenue per keyword category |
| **Google Display/YouTube** | View rate, video completion rate, retargeting pool growth | View-through conversions, assisted conversions |
| **Meta** | CTR, CPL, lead volume, frequency | Lead-to-SQL rate, cost per SQL, pipeline value |

### Reporting Cadence

| Frequency | What to Report | Who Sees It |
|---|---|---|
| **Weekly** | Platform metrics, pacing, budget utilization | Paid media team |
| **Monthly** | Cross-channel performance, pipeline attribution, CPL/CPA trends | Marketing leadership |
| **Quarterly** | Full-funnel ROI, channel efficiency, strategy adjustments | Executive team, sales leadership |

## Common Mistakes in B2B Paid Media

### Strategy Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Hurts | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Running only bottom-funnel campaigns** | Only captures the 5% in-market now, ignores the 95% | Add awareness campaigns on LinkedIn/YouTube |
| **Running only top-funnel without capture** | Building awareness but not converting when buyers are ready | Add Google Search for in-market capture |
| **Spreading budget across too many channels** | No channel gets enough spend to optimize | Focus on 1-2 channels until each is working, then expand |
| **Optimizing for leads instead of pipeline** | Cheap leads that don't convert waste sales time | Measure cost per SQL and pipeline value, not just CPL |
| **Same creative across all channels** | Each platform has different user behavior and format strengths | Adapt creative to each platform's native format |

### Targeting Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Hurts | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Targeting too broadly on LinkedIn** | Budget diluted, off-target impressions | Use AND narrowing, add seniority + company size filters |
| **Targeting too narrowly on LinkedIn** | CPMs spike, algorithm cannot optimize | Keep cold audiences 50K+ |
| **Ignoring negative keywords on Google** | Irrelevant searches waste budget | Audit search terms weekly, add negatives |
| **Not excluding converters from all campaigns** | Paying to reach people who already bought | Create exclusion audiences across all platforms |
| **Using Meta interest targeting alone for B2B** | Interest targeting is too broad for B2B precision | Use lookalikes from customer data or website visitors |

### Measurement Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Hurts | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Judging LinkedIn by last-click conversions** | LinkedIn drives awareness, rarely last-click | Use self-reported attribution + impression tracking |
| **Comparing CPL across channels without quality** | $50 LinkedIn lead may close at 3x the rate of a $20 Meta lead | Track CPL-to-SQL conversion rate per channel |
| **No self-reported attribution** | Cannot see dark social influence | Add "How did you hear about us?" field on every form |
| **Monthly reporting only** | Missing optimization windows | Weekly platform metrics, monthly strategy review |

### Operational Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Hurts | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Not setting up retargeting audiences before launching** | LinkedIn audiences are not retroactive - data lost permanently | Create all retargeting audiences on day 1 |
| **Creative fatigue (same ads for 3+ months)** | Declining CTR, rising CPC, audience annoyance | Refresh creative every 4-8 weeks |
| **No conversion tracking installed** | Flying blind - cannot optimize for what matters | Install LinkedIn Insight Tag, Google Tag, Meta Pixel before launching |
| **Launching campaigns on Friday** | Weekend has lower B2B engagement, wastes initial learning budget | Launch Monday or Tuesday morning |

## Funnel Stage Mapping

### The Four Stages

| Stage | Goal | Content Type | Key Channels | Success Metric |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Awareness** | Get on their radar, build brand | Thought leadership, industry trends, educational content | LinkedIn (TLAs, video), YouTube | Impressions, engagement rate, retargeting pool growth |
| **Consideration** | Show how you solve their problem | Case studies, product demos, comparison content, webinars | LinkedIn, Google Search, Meta | CTR, content consumption, retargeting engagement |
| **Conversion** | Drive action - demo, trial, purchase | Customer testimonials, ROI proof, free trials, demo offers | Google Search (brand), LinkedIn BOF, Meta conversions | Cost per conversion, conversion rate, pipeline generated |
| **Expansion** | Grow existing accounts | Feature announcements, upsell content, success stories | LinkedIn, Email, Meta (custom audiences) | Upsell revenue, NRR impact |

### Stage Progression Benchmarks (ABM Context)

| Transition | Benchmark | Timeframe |
|---|---|---|
| Identified - Aware | 55% of accounts | 30-60 days |
| Aware - Considering | 32% of accounts | 60-90 days |
| Considering - Opportunity | 18% of accounts | 90-120 days |

### Content-to-Stage Map

| Content | Awareness | Consideration | Conversion |
|---|---|---|---|
| Thought leadership posts | Primary | - | - |
| Industry reports/data | Primary | Secondary | - |
| Product demos | - | Primary | Secondary |
| Case studies | - | Primary | Primary |
| Comparison guides | - | Primary | Secondary |
| Customer testimonials | - | Secondary | Primary |
| Free trial/demo offers | - | - | Primary |
| ROI calculators | - | - | Primary |

## How Ads and Outbound Work Together

Paid ads and outbound prospecting are not separate programs. They are two parts of the same motion.

### The Integration Model

```
Ads create awareness with target accounts
  ↓
Engagement data reveals which accounts are interested
  ↓
Intent signals trigger personalized BDR outreach
  ↓
BDR conversations inform next round of ad creative
```

### Why This Matters

| Approach | Reply Rate | Meeting Book Rate |
|---|---|---|
| Cold outreach (no ad exposure) | 6-8% | Low |
| Signal-based outreach (ABM-warmed) | 18-22% | 2-3x higher |
| Multi-signal stacked (ads + intent + timing) | 35-40% | 3-5x higher |

### How It Works in Practice

1. **LinkedIn ABM ads** run against your target account list
2. **Intent detection tools** (ZenABM, Fibbler) capture which accounts engage with which campaigns
3. **CRM workflows** (HubSpot) tag accounts with intent data and trigger BDR alerts
4. **BDRs personalize outreach** based on what the account engaged with - the ad topic, not the ad channel
5. **Sales feedback loops** inform which messages and angles work, feeding back into ad creative

**Critical rule:** Never say "I saw you clicked our ad." Reference the topic they showed interest in, not the channel.

## Platform-Specific Quick Reference

### LinkedIn

- Best B2B targeting precision (job title, seniority, company, industry)
- Expensive ($8-22 CPC) but reaches decision-makers directly
- TLAs outperform company page ads 3-6x in CTR
- Always turn OFF Audience Expansion and LinkedIn Audience Network
- Full guide: [linkedin-ads/](./linkedin-ads/)

### Google Ads

- Captures active buying intent via search keywords
- Brand keywords are defensive - always bid on your own brand
- Non-brand keywords capture solution-seeking buyers
- Display/YouTube supplements LinkedIn for broader awareness
- Requires weekly search term audits and negative keyword management

### Meta

- Algorithm-driven optimization rewards strong creative
- Best for retargeting website visitors and lookalike expansion
- B2B targeting relies on lookalikes and custom audiences (not interests)
- Lower CPL than LinkedIn but lead quality varies - measure CPL-to-SQL rate
- Double line breaks between paragraphs in ad copy for readability

## Getting Started Checklist

If you are launching B2B paid media from zero:

1. **Install tracking first** - LinkedIn Insight Tag, Google Tag, Meta Pixel on your website
2. **Set up retargeting audiences** on all platforms before launching any ads
3. **Add self-reported attribution** ("How did you hear about us?") to every form
4. **Start with one channel** - pick the highest-impact platform for your situation
5. **Launch bottom-funnel first** if you have existing website traffic - retarget before prospecting
6. **Launch top-funnel first** if you have no existing traffic - build awareness before conversion
7. **Give it 90 days** before judging ROI - B2B sales cycles are long
8. **Optimize weekly** - platforms reward active management
9. **Add a second channel** only after the first is performing and you have capacity to manage both
10. **Measure pipeline, not leads** - the metric that matters is revenue, not form fills
